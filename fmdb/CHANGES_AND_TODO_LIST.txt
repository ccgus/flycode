TODO:
A connection manager, so you can checkout and hit the same db over different threads.  Although I guess the latest versions of sqlite can be compiled as thread safe..

Some bug fixes + warning fixes from Brad Stern (thanks again Brad!)

2008.10.03
Fixed a crasher in FMResultSet's close where if the parent DB was already released, the result set would be talking to a bad address and fmdb went boom. (thanks to Brian Stern for the patch)

2008.06.06
Thanks to Zach Wily for the return of FMDatabaseAdditions!

2008.06.03:
Removed all exceptions, now you should use [db hadError] to check for an error.  I hate (ns)exceptions, I'm not sure why I put them in.
Moved to google code.
Various little cleanup thingies.

2008.07.03
Thanks to Kris Markel for some extra trace outputs, and a fix where the database would be locked if it was too busy.

2008.07.10
Thanks to Daniel Pasco and Bil Moorehead for catching a problem where the column names lookup table was created on every row iteration.  Doh! 

2008.07.18
FMDatabase will now cache statements if you turn it on using shouldCacheStatements:YES.  In theory, this should speed things up.  Test it out, let me know if it makes things good for ya.
Note: This is pretty new code, so it hasn't gone through a lot of testing... you've been warned. (seems to work though!)

2008.00.01
Fixed a problemo that kept it from compiling for the iPhone (Thanks to Sam Steele for the patch)
